# CRUD_IOS_Sample

I have added following functionalities in the sample code:
- Image listing with animations to load images locally
- CRUD operations using core data where user can add Name, version and company name. The records will get saved in local database. User can view record details, delete record using swipe action and able to update records as well.
- Map view controller to update user location based on current location.

This demo app is created in objective-c using Xcode 7.
I have attached screenshots and source code for your reference.
